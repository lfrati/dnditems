  Abracadabrus:
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em></p>\n<p>An <em>abracadabrus</em> is an ornate, gemstone-studded wooden chest that weighs 25 pounds while empty. Its interior compartment is a cube measuring 1\u00a01/2 feet on a side.</p>\n<p>The chest has 20 charges. A creature can use an action to touch the closed lid of the chest and expend 1 of the chest's charges while naming one or more nonmagical objects (including raw materials, foodstuffs, and liquids) worth a total of 1 gp or less. The named objects magically appear in the chest, provided they can all fit inside it and the chest doesn't contain anything else. For example, the chest can conjure a plate of strawberries, a bowl of hot soup, a flagon of water, a stuffed animal, or a bag of twenty caltrops. Food and drink conjured by the chest are delicious, and they spoil if not consumed after 24 hours. Gems and precious metals created by the chest disappear after 1 minute.</p>\n<p>The chest regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn. If the item's last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the chest loses its magic (becoming an ordinary chest), and its gemstones turn to dust.</p>",

The ball then expands to form a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn't reduced. A creature whose speed is reduced by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Lightning Shot.</em></strong> The cannon shoots a ball of lightning to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The lightning then expands to form a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6dl0) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the save.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Poison Spray.</em></strong> The cannon expels poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>",

  "Axe of the Dwarvish Lords":
    '<p id=info><em>Weapon (battleaxe), artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.</p>\n<p>Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the <em>Brutal Pick</em>, the <em>Earthheart Forge</em>, the <em>Anvil of Songs</em>, and the <em>Shaping Hammer</em>. With them, he forged the <em>Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</em>.</p>\n<p>Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.</p>\n<p>Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic Weapon.</strong> The <em>Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</em> is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:belt-of-dwarvenkind">Belt of Dwarvenkind</a>, a <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:dwarven-thrower">Dwarven Thrower</a>, and a <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:sword-of-sharpness">Sword of Sharpness</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Random Properties.</strong> The axe has the following randomly determined properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\n<li>2 minor detrimental properties</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Blessings of Moradin.</strong> If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have immunity to poison damage.</li>\n<li>The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet.</li>\n<li>You gain proficiency with artisan\'s tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conjure Earth Elemental.</strong> If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:conjure-elemental">Conjure Elemental</a> spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can\'t use this property again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p><strong>Travel the Depths.</strong> You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can\'t use this property again until 3 days have passed.</p>\n<p><strong>Curse.</strong> The axe bears a curse that affects any nondwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature\'s physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren\'t considered magical in nature (and therefore can\'t be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:greater-restoration">Greater Restoration</a> or <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse">Remove Curse</a> spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Destroying the Axe.</strong> The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the <em>Earthheart Forge</em>, where it was created.

  Azuredge:

The axe head is forged from silver, electrum, and steel alloys whose edges constantly shimmer with a deep blue luminescence.</p>\n<p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:shield">Shield</a> spell provides no defense against the axe, which passes through that spell\'s barrier of magical force.</p>\n<p>When you hit a fiend or an undead with the axe, cold blue flames erupt from its blade and deal an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Hurling.</em></strong> The battleaxe has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged attack with the axe, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. Whether it hits or misses, the axe flies back to you at the end of the current turn, landing in your open hand or al your feet in your space (as you choose). The axe regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Illumination.</em></strong> While holding the axe, you can use an action to cause the axe to glow blue or to quench the glow. This glow sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> <em>Azuredge</em> is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>\n<p>The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. It has a calm, delicate voice. The weapon can sense the presence of non-lawful creatures within 120 feet of it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> <em>Azuredge</em> is sworn to protect Waterdeep, and it desires to be wielded by a law-abiding person willing to dedicate everything to the city\'s defense. The weapon is patient and takes its time finding its ideal wielder.</p>\n<p>If someone tries to use <em>Azuredge</em> against its will, the axe can become ten times heavier than normal, and can magically adhere to any Medium or larger object or surface it comes into contact with. Once it does so, the axe can\'t be wielded. Nothing short of a <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish">Wish</a> spell can separate the axe from the item or surface to which it is adhered without destroying one or the other, though the axe can choose to end the effect at any time.</p>',
  "Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle":
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: <em>Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle</em>. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Properties of the Mortar.</em></strong> The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding \u2014 if there's enough space \u2014 up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Properties of the Pestle.</em></strong> The pestle is a 6-inchlong, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>\n<p>The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Perfect Tools.</em></strong> While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>You can also use the artifact as alchemist's supplies, brewer's supplies, cook's utensils, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner's it. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Primal Parts.</em></strong> As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4dl0 force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents \u2014 like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs \u2014 into separate piles.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Traverse the Night.</em></strong> If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature. You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination \u2014 not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Bones Know Their Home.</em></strong> When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Destroying the Mortar and Pestle.</em></strong> The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the <em>Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga</em> or by Baba Yaga herself.</p>",

    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em></p>\n<p>This bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.</p>\n<p>The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.</p>\n<p>Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM determines the time and plane.</p>\n<p>If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.</p>",
  "Bag of Holding":

Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.</p>\n<p>If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.</p>\n<p>Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a <em><a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:hewards-handy-haversack">Heward\'s Handy Haversack</a>, <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:portable-hole">Portable Hole</a></em>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane.

Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.</p>\n<p>In the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor\u2014someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Spirit Trap.</em></strong> When the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs.

  "Book of Exalted Deeds":
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)</em></p>\n<p>The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the fabled <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various authors filled the pages with their own vision of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil.</p>\n<p>The <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.</p>\n<p>A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.</p>\n<p>Benefits granted by the <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> last only as long as you strive to do good.

This halo sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo's bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Destroying the Book.</em></strong> It is rumored that the <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> can't be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse.

  "Book of Vile Darkness":

No mortal was meant to know the secrets it contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites madness.</p>\n<p>Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em>. He recorded in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.</p>\n<p>Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can't be divined.</p>\n<p>Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.</p>\n<p>A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.</p>\n<p>Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em>, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to neutral evil.</p>\n<p>The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears.

The book can't adjust your ability scores again.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mark of Darkness.</em></strong> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Command Evil.</em></strong> While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-monster\">Dominate Monster</a> spell on an evil target (save DC 18).

When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dark Speech.</em></strong> While you carry the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite word from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Destroying the Book.</em></strong> The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.</p>\n<p>If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.</p>\n<p>A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 x 100 years later.</p>\n<p>If all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed.</p>",

  "Crook of Rao":
    '<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the <em>Crook of Rao</em> was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse \u2014 and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact\'s bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the <em>Crook of Rao</em> \u2014 potentially for the final time.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the <em>Dungeon Master\'s Guide</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> The crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:aura-of-life">Aura of Life</a> (2 charges), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:aura-of-purity">Aura of Purity</a> (2 charges), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:banishment">Banishment</a> (1 charge), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:beacon-of-hope">Beacon of Hope</a> (1 charge), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mass-cure-wounds">Mass Cure Wounds</a> (3 charges). The crook regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Absolute Banishment.</em></strong> While you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can\'t return to the plane the <em>Crook of Rao</em> banished it from for 100 years.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Failing Matrix.</em></strong> Whenever the Crook of Rao\'s Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are not under your control.</p>\n<table class="wiki-content-table">\n<tr>\n<th colspan="2">Extraplanar Reversal</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>d100</th>\n<th>Effect</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01-25</td>\n<td>A portal to a random plane opens.

Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the <em>Crook of Rao</em>, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend\'s name in lggwilv\'s voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the <em>Crook of Rao</em>. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Destroying or Repairing the Crook.</em></strong> The <em>Crook of Rao</em> can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god\'s tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.</p>',

Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.</li>\n<li>As a bonus action, you can speak a command word and use the goggles to see into and through solid matter. This vision has a radius of 60 feet and lasts for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</li>\n<li>As a bonus action, you can speak a command word to switch the goggles into spyglass mode. While in this mode, creatures and objects viewed through the goggles are magnified to twice their size.

Its voice is kind and feminine. It knows every language you know while you\'re attuned to it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> Forged by ancient sun worshippers, <em>Dawnbringer</em> is meant to bring light into darkness and to fight creatures of darkness. It is kind and compassionate to those in need, but fierce and destructive to its enemies.</p>\n<p>Long years lost in darkness have made <em>Dawnbringer</em> frightened of both the dark and abandonment. It prefers that its blade always be present and shedding light in areas of darkness, and it strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time.</p>',

  "Decanter of Endless Water":
    '<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p>\n<p>This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.</p>\n<p>You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask.

The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you.</li>\n</ul>',
  "Deck of Illusions":
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p>\n<p>This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.</p>\n<p>The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.</p>\n<p>An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature (as presented in the <em>Monster Manual</em>), except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.</p>\n<p>The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled.

When you hit with an attack using the bident, the target takes an extra 2d10 cold damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Blessing of the Deep.</em></strong> If you are a worshiper of Thassa, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Piety 10+.</strong> You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed of 60 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Piety 25+.</strong> The bident has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.</li>\n<li><strong>Piety 50+.</strong> The bident has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you aren't a worshiper of Thassa, the bident has 1 minor detrimental property and 1 major detrimental property, both randomly determined.</p>\n<p>See \"Artifacts\" in chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> for details on randomly determined properties.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Command the Deep.</em></strong> The bident holds the power to command the waves and its creatures.

  "Demonomicon of Iggwilv":
    '<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>An expansive treatise documenting the Abyss\'s infinite layers and inhabitants, the <em>Demonomicon of lggwilv</em> is the most thorough and blasphemous tome of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book\'s spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The artifact has the follow random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the <em>Dungeon Master\'s Guide</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> The book has 8 charges. It regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to cast <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:tashas-hideous-laughter">Tasha\'s Hideous Laughter</a> from it or to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 20) from it: <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:magic-circle">Magic Circle</a> (1 charge), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:magic-jar">Magic Jar</a> (3 charges), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:planar-ally">Planar Ally</a> (3 charges), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:planar-binding">Planar Binding</a> (2 charges), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:plane-shift">Plane Shift</a> (to layers of the Abyss only; 3 charges), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:summon-fiend">Summon Fiend</a> (3 charges; appears in this book).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Abyssal Reference.</em></strong> You can reference the <em>Demonomicon</em> whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Fiendish Scourging.</em></strong> Your magic causes pain to fiends. While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Ensnarement.</em></strong> While carrying the book, whenever you cast the <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:magic-circle">Magic Circle</a> spell naming only fiends, or the <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:planar-binding">Planar Binding</a> spell targeting a fiend, the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the fiend has disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Containment.</em></strong> The first 10 pages of the <em>Demonomicon</em> are blank. As an action while holding the book, you can target a fiend that you can see that is trapped within a <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:magic-circle">Magic Circle</a>. The fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with disadvantage or become trapped within one of the <em>Demonornicon</em>\'s empty blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature\'s widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can\'t be used again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p>When you finish a long rest, if you and the <em>Demonomicon</em> are on the same plane of existence, the trapped creature of the highest challenge rating within the book can attempt to possess you. You must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. The possessing creature can release you as an action, appearing in the closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the fiend can\'t try to possess you again for 7 days.</p>\n<p>When the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 fiends occupying its pages, typically an assortment of demons.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Destroying the Demonomicon.</em></strong> To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book\'s pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book\'s remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, Fraz-Urb\'luu\'s Staff. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the <em>Tome of Zyx</em>, the work that served as the foundation for the <em>Demonomicon</em>. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb\'luu instantly knows.</p>',
  "Devastation Orb":
    '<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em></p>\n<p>A <em>Devastation Orb</em> is an elemental bomb that can be created at the site of an elemental node by performing a ritual with an elemental weapon. The type of orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a <em>Devastation Orb of Air</em>. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed.</p>\n<p>A <em>Devastation Orb</em> measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates 1d100 hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:identify">Identify</a> and <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:divination">Divination</a> can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.</p>\n<p>A special container can be crafted to contain a <em>Devastation Orb</em> and prevent it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols of the orb\u2019s opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used to contain a <em>Devastation Orb of Air</em> and keep it from detonating. While in the container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes 1d6 rounds later, unless it is returned to the container.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with a 1 mile radius. The orb is the sphere\u2019s point of origin. The orb is destroyed after one use.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Air Orb.</em></strong> When this orb detonates, it creates a powerful windstorm that lasts for 1 hour. Whenever a creature ends its turn exposed to the wind, the creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage, as the wind and debris batter it. The wind is strong enough to uproot weak trees and destroy light structures after at least 10 minutes of exposure. Otherwise, the rules for strong wind apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the <em>Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Earth Orb.</em></strong> When this orb detonates, it subjects the area to the effects of the <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:earthquake">Earthquake</a> spell for 1 minute (spell save DC 18). For the purpose of the spell\u2019s effects, the spell is cast on the turn that the orb explodes.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Fire Orb.</em></strong> When this orb detonates, it creates a dry heat wave that lasts for 24 hours. Within the area of effect, the rules for extreme heat apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the <em>Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide</em>. At the end of each hour, there is a ten percent chance that the heat wave starts a wildfire in a random location within the area of effect. The wildfire covers a 10-foot-square area initially but expands to fill another 10-foot square each round until the fire is extinguished or burns itself out. A creature that comes within 10 feet of a wildfire for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 3d6 fire damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Water Orb.</em></strong> When this orb detonates, it creates a torrential rainstorm that lasts for 24 hours. Within the area of effect, the rules for heavy precipitation apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the <em>Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide</em>. If there is a substantial body of water in the area, it floods after 2d10 hours of heavy rain, rising 10 feet above its banks and inundating the surrounding area. The flood advances at a rate of 100 feet per round, moving away from the body of water where it began until it reaches the edge of the area of effect: at that point, the water flows downhill (and possibly recedes back to its origin). Light structures collapse and wash away. Any Large or smaller creature caught in the flood\u2019s path is swept away. The flooding destroys crops and might trigger mudslides, depending on the terrain.</p>',

They don't prevent the creature from passing-through an interdimensional portal.</p>\n<p>You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them.

  Draakhorn:
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, unique</em></p>\n<p>The <em>Draakhorn</em> was a gift from Tiamat in the war between dragons and giants. It was once the horn of her ancient red dragon consort, Ephelomon, that she gave to dragonkind to help them in their war against the giants. The <em>Draakhorn</em> is a signaling device, and it is so large that it requires two Medium creatures (or one Large or larger) to hold it while a third creature sounds it, making the earth resonate to its call. The horn has been blasted with fire into a dark ebony hue and is wrapped in bands of bronze with draconic runes that glow with purple eldritch fire.</p>\n<p>The low, moaning drone of the <em>Draakhorn</em> discomfits normal animals within a few miles, and it alerts all dragons within two thousand miles to rise and be wary, for great danger is at hand. Coded blasts were once used to signal specific messages. Knowledge of those codes has been lost to the ages.</p>\n<p>Those with knowledge of the <em>Draakhorn\u2019s</em> history know that it was first built to signal danger to chromatic dragons \u2014- a purpose the Cult of the Dragon has corrupted to call chromatic dragons to the Well of Dragons from across the North.</p>\n<p>While the horn is sounding, a creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw the first time on a turn the creature enters a 150-foot cone in front of the horn or starts its turn there. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn\u2019t knocked prone.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this bow, and you suffer no disadvantage when attacking at the weapon\'s long range. Additionally, <em>Ephixis</em> scores a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Blessing of the Wild.</em></strong> If you are a worshiper of Nylea, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Piety 10+.</strong> The bow has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.</li>\n<li><strong>Piety 25+.</strong> The bow has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you aren\'t a worshiper of Nylea, the bow has 1 randomly determined major detrimental property.</p>\n<p>See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master\'s Guide</em> for details on randomly determined properties.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Arrows of the Seasons.</em></strong> The four arrows \u2014 each associated with a season \u2014 that accompany this bow can be fired only from it. Each arrow disappears immediately after it\'s used, and it reappears in the quiver at the next dusk. The save DC against spells cast with the arrows is 18. Each arrow has a unique property:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spring.</strong> As an action, you can fire this arrow, targeting a beast or a plant creature you can see within 320 feet of you. On a hit, the arrow deals no damage, and the target gains the benefits of the awaken spell for 8 hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Summer.</strong> As an action, you can fire this arrow at an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required. A Nyxborn lynx is summoned in that space (use the stat block for a <strong>tiger</strong> with the Nyxborn traits from chapter 6 of MOT). The lynx understands your verbal commands and obeys them as best it can, and it takes its turns immediately after yours. The emissary remains for 1 hour before fading away.</li>\n<li><strong>Autumn.</strong> As an action, you can fire this arrow at a space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required, casting the <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wall-of-thorns">Wall of Thorns</a> spell there.</li>\n<li><strong>Winter.</strong> As an action, you can fire this arrow at a space that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required, casting the <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:ice-storm">Ice Storm</a> spell there.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Destroying the Bow.</em></strong> The bow can\'t be destroyed without first destroying all its arrows. The winter arrow must be fed to a cerberus on the winter solstice. The spring arrow must be planted at the base of a Black Oak of Asphodel on the spring equinox. The summer arrow must be broken by a sea giant on the summer solstice. Then the autumn arrow must be shot into the carcass of a hydra on the autumnal equinox. When all four arrows are destroyed, the bow and quiver dissolve into dust.</p>',

  "Eye and Hand of Vecna":
    '<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed voice. Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn\'t escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.</p>\n<p>Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.</p>\n<p>Some say that Vecna\'s lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King\'s rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna\'s tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One\'s will in the world.</p>\n<p>The <em>Eye of Vecna</em> and the <em>Hand of Vecna</em> might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.</p>\n<p>To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.</p>\n<p>To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The <em>Eye of Vecna</em> and the <em>Hand of Vecna</em> each have the following random properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 minor beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Properties of the Eye.</em></strong> Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have truesight.</li>\n<li>You can use an action to see as if you were wearing a <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:ring-of-x-ray-vision">Ring of X-Ray Vision</a>.

Each time you cast a spell from the hand, it casts the <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:suggestion">Suggestion</a> spell on you (save DC 18), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Properties of the Eye and Hand.</em></strong> If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are immune to disease and poison.</li>\n<li>Using the eye\'s X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion.</li>\n<li>You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can\'t be surprised.</li>\n<li>If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d10 hit points.</li>\n<li>If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the <em>Hand of Vecna</em>.

Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact reappears in one of Vecna\'s many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.</p>',

  "Guild Keyrune":
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, rarity by keyrune (requires attunement by a member of the relevant guild)</em></p>\n<p>Associated with a particular guild, a <em>guild keyrune</em> is a ceremonial, stylized key, about 1 foot long, made from carved stone. Not a literal key, the item is a badge of authority that gives its bearer access to privileged places in its guild's headquarters and outposts. At the DM's discretion, a character might be given a keyrune upon attaining a renown score of 25 in their guild.</p>\n<p>When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a creature. If there isn't enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn't transform. See the <em>Monster Manual</em> for the creature's stat block \u2014 the name of which is given in bold in the keyrune's description \u2014 unless you're directed to chapter 6 of this book instead.</p>\n<p>The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger.</p>\n<p>The creature exists for a duration specific to each keyrune. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Azorius Keyrune (Rare).</em></strong> This keyrune is carved from white marble and lapis lazuli to resemble a noble bird of prey. It can become a <strong>giant eagle</strong> for up to 1 hour. While the transformed eagle is within l mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.

Anyone who talks with the transformed keyrune or examines it closely can easily recognize that it is an artificial human.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dimir Keyrune (Very Rare).</em></strong> This keyrune, carved from black stone accented with steel, resembles a stylized horror. On command, it transforms into an <strong>intellect devourer</strong> that resembles the Dimir guild symbol, with six bladelike legs. The creature exists for up to 24 hours. During that time, it pursues only a single mission you give it \u2014 usually an assignment to take over someone's body, either to impersonate that person for a brief time or to extract secrets from their mind. When the mission is complete, the creature returns to you, reports its success, and reverts to its keyrune form.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Golgari Keyrune (Very Rare).</em></strong> Made from deep green jade with black veins, this keyrune has an insectile shape. It can transform into a <strong>giant scorpion</strong> for up to 6 hours. The scorpion has an Intelligence of 4 and can communicate with you telepathically while it is within 60 feet of you, though its messages are largely limited to describing the passage of potential prey.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Gruul Keyrune (Rare).</em></strong> This crude keyrune is cobbled together from bits of rubble, broken glass, bone, and animal hair. One end resembles a horned beast. On command, the keyrune transforms into a ceratok, a horned creature much like a <strong>rhinoceros</strong> (and with the same statistics). It remains in its ceratok form for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Izzet Keyrune (Rare).</em></strong> Formed of carved and polished red and blue stone, the keyrune includes bits of cable and wire. One end resembles a humanlike head, suggesting the jagged elemental form of the <strong>galvanice weird</strong> (see chapter 6 for the stat block) that it can become for a duration of 3 hours. In this form, it will serve you as a bodyguard, lift and carry things for you, act as a test subject for your experiments, or aid you in any other way that its capabilities allow.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Orzhov Keyrune (Rare).</em></strong> This keyrune is carved from white marble with veins of black. The end is shaped like a thrull's head, with a gold faceplate affixed. On command, the keyrune transforms into a <strong>winged thrull</strong> (see chapter 6 for the stat block) for up to 2 hours. If you don't come from an Orzhov oligarch family, it serves you grudgingly, clownishly aping your movements and mannerisms while carrying out your orders.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Rakdos Keyrune (Uncommon).</em></strong> This dark granite keyrune is marbled with scarlet veins and carved with the leering visage of a mischievous demon. When activated, it transforms into a <strong>cackler</strong> (see chapter 6 for the stat block) for up to 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Selesnya Keyrune (Rare).</em></strong> Carved from white and green marble in the shape of a wolf's head, this keyrune transforms into a <strong>dire wolf</strong>.

While it is within 1 mile of you. you can communicate with each other telepathically.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Simic Keyrune (Uncommon).</em></strong> This keyrune is assembled from coral, mother-of pearl, and chrome and adorned with the spirals and curves characteristic of Simic ornamentation. The head resembles the shell of a sea creature.

The transformation lasts for up to 5 hours.</p>",

    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)</em></p>\n<p>Iggwilv crafted this wondrous cauldron with the help of her adoptive mother, the archfey Baba Yaga. The cauldron has two forms. Only Iggwilv or Baba Yaga can change the cauldron from one form to another (by using an action to touch it), which either can do without being attuned to the item. In its first form, the cauldron is made of solid gold and embossed on the outside with images of bare-branched trees, falling leaves, and broomsticks. In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes\u2014eight of each animal. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds when empty, and it can hold up to 100 gallons of liquid.</p>\n<p><strong>Attunement.</strong> Any Humanoid creature that attunes to the cauldron must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be aged to the point of decrepitude. In this state, the creature's speed is halved, the range of its vision and hearing is reduced to 30 feet, and it has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The creature will reach the end of its natural life span in 3d8 days. Only a <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish\">Wish</a> spell or divine intervention can reverse this aging effect on the creature.</p>\n<p>Three hags can attune to the cauldron simultaneously, provided they have formed a coven.

The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew.</li>\n<li>If wine is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 10 minutes, it transforms into a magical elixir that fortifies up to four people per gallon of wine used. Any creature that imbibes the elixir gains 10 temporary hit points. Any of the elixir that isn't consumed within 1 hour vanishes. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.</li>\n<li>When the cauldron is filled with 90 gallons of water mixed with 10 gallons of wine, it can be used as the focus for a <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:scrying\">Scrying</a> spell. When this spell is cast using the cauldron as its focus, the target of the spell fails its saving throw automatically, and the spell works even if its caster and the target are on different planes of existence. When the spell ends, all the liquid in the cauldron vanishes.</li>\n<li>Dipping the bristles of an ordinary broom into the water-filled cauldron transforms the broom into a <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:broom-of-flying\">Broom of Flying</a> for 3 days. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Iron Cauldron.</strong> The iron cauldron has the following properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use an action to scream into the empty cauldron, which magically summons a <strong>swarm of bats</strong> that flies out of the cauldron and acts immediately after you in the initiative order. The swarm obeys your commands and disappears after 1 minute if it hasn't been destroyed by then. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.</li>\n<li>If at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a cloud of harmless black smoke that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all Humanoid creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall unconscious for 1 hour, except those that are attuned to the cauldron or immune to being charmed. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An unconscious creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.</li>\n<li>Tying a dead frog or toad to the end of an ordinary branch and dipping it in the water-filled cauldron transforms the branch into a <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:wand-of-polymorph\">Wand of Polymorph</a> with 3 charges. This wand can't recharge and crumbles to ashes when its final charge is expended. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again for 8 days.</li>\n<li>If you spend 1 minute touching the cauldron with a unicorn's horn while reciting the poem called \"The Witch Queen's Cauldron\", all creatures within 1,000 feet of the cauldron except those that are attuned to it become frozen in time. A time-frozen creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak, doesn't age, and is unaware of its surroundings or the passage of time. Moreover, it can't be moved, harmed in any way, or affected by any other magic. All other conditions and effects on the creature are suppressed until it is no longer frozen in time. Destroying the cauldron, sending it to another plane of existence, or touching it with a unicorn's horn for 1 minute while reciting \"The Witch Queen's Cauldron\" ends the time-freezing effect on all creatures. The effect also ends on any creature that comes into contact with an antimagic field or is touched by a unicorn's horn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Destroying the Cauldron.</strong> The cauldron is a Medium object with AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to damage from any source other than a <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:flame-tongue\">Flame Tongue</a> or <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:frost-brand\">Frost Brand</a> weapon. Reducing the cauldron to 0 hit points with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size, whereupon all ongoing effects created by the cauldron end as it loses its magic.</p>\n<p>The destruction of <em>Iggwilv's Cauldron</em> causes all hags in the multiverse to lose the Shared Spellcasting trait gained by being in a coven (see the \"Hag Covens\" sidebar in the <em>Monster Manual</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>Reconstructing the Cauldron.</strong> If all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish\">Wish</a> spell can reassemble them, restoring the cauldron and all its properties.

  "Infernal Puzzle Box":
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p>\n<p>An <em>infernal puzzle box</em> is a cube-shaped container 5 to 6 inches on a side, composed of airtight, interlocking parts made from materials found in the Nine Hells. Most of these boxes are made of infernal iron, though some are carved from bone or horn. <em>Infernal puzzle boxes</em> are used to safeguard diabolical contracts signed between devils and mortals, even after the terms of these contracts are fulfilled. An empty <em>infernal puzzle box</em> weighs 3 pounds regardless of the materials used to fashion it.</p>\n<p>When an object small enough to fit inside an <em>infernal puzzle box</em> is placed in it, the container magically seals shut around the object, and no magic can force the box open. The sealed box becomes immune to all damage as well. Every <em>infernal puzzle box</em> is constructed with a unique means of opening it. The trick to solving the puzzle is always mundane, never magical. Once a creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open a particular <em>infernal puzzle box</em>, that creature can open the box as an action, allowing access to the box's contents.</p>\n<p>A creature that spends 1 hour holding an <em>infernal puzzle box</em> while trying to open it can make a DC 30 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the check succeeds, the creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open the box. If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>",

A nightmare equipped with <em>infernal tack</em> must serve whoever wears the spurs until the wearer dies or the tack is removed.</p>\n<p>You can use an action to call the nightmare equipped with <em>infernal tack</em> by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of your next turn, within 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If the nightmare dies, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again.</p>\n<p>The tack doesn't conjure a nightmare from thin air; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and become partners in evil.</p>",

  "Luba's Tarokka of Souls":
    '<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>Not all lingering spirits are tragic souls, lost on their way to the hereafter. Some languish as prisoners, souls so wicked mortals dare not free them upon an unsuspecting afterlife.</p>\n<p>Created by a figure of Vistani legend, <em>Luba\'s Tarokka of Souls</em> shaped the destiny of countless heroes. The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck\'s creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning them within her tarroka deck. There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul \u2014 as it inevitably will.</p>\n<p>Like all tarokka decks, the <em>Tarokka of Souls</em> is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the <em>Dungeon Master\'s Guide</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor detrimental properties</li>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> While holding the deck, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:comprehend-languages">Comprehend Languages</a>, <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-evil-and-good">Detect Evil and Good</a>, <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-magic">Detect Magic</a>, <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-poison-and-disease">Detect Poison and Disease</a>, <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:locate-object">Locate Object</a>, or <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:scrying">Scrying</a>.

  "Mighty Servant of Leuk-o":
    '<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>Named for the warlord who infamously employed it, the <em>Mighty Servant of Leuk-o</em> is a fantastically powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns into an animate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it \u2014 and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.</p>\n<p>Tales of the servant\'s origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:the-infernal-machine-of-lum-the-mad">Machine of Lum the Mad</a>. The best details on the device\'s origins and operation can be found in the <em>Mind of Metal</em>, a tome of artificer\'s secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad\'s several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled <em>Mighty Servant of Leuk-o</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dangerous Attunement.</em></strong> Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens.</p>\n<p>The servant\'s controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.</p>\n<p>Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Controlling the Servant.</em></strong> While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves\' tools. A <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:knock">Knock</a> spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster\'s next turn.</p>\n<p>A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have total cover from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.</p>\n<p>While you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)</li>\n<li>Move the servant up to its speed (no action required)</li>\n<li>As an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.</li>\n<li>When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Ghost in the Machine.</em></strong> Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM\'s discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.</p>\n<p>If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact \u2014 preferably using the servant, if possible.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Self-Destruct.</em></strong> By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant\'s two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.</p>\n<p>If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100 foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.</p>\n<p>This does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts \u2014 left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso \u2014 drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Destroying the Servant.</em></strong> The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:the-infernal-machine-of-lum-the-mad">Machine of Lum the Mad</a>, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant\'s Self-Destruct property.</p>\n<table class="wiki-content-table">\n<tr>\n<th colspan="6">Mighty Servant of Leuk-o</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6"><em>Huge Construct</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6"><strong>Armor Class</strong> 22 (natural armor)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6"><strong>Hit Points</strong> 310 (27d12 + 135)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6"><strong>Speed</strong> 60 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>STR</th>\n<th>DEX</th>\n<th>CON</th>\n<th>INT</th>\n<th>WIS</th>\n<th>CHA</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30 (+10)</td>\n<td>14 (+2)</td>\n<td>20 (+5)</td>\n<td>1 (-5)</td>\n<td>14 (+2)</td>\n<td>10 (+0)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6"><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Wis +9, Cha +7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6"><strong>Skills:</strong> Perception +9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6"><strong>Damage Resistances:</strong> piercing, slashing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6"><strong>Damage Immunities:</strong> acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6"><strong>Condition Immunities:</strong> all conditions but invisible and prone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6"><strong>Senses:</strong> blindsight 120 ft., passive Perception 19</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6"><strong>Languages:</strong> understands the languages of creatures attuned to it but can\'t speak</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6"><strong>Challenge:</strong> \u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6"><strong>Proficiency Bonus:</strong> +7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6"><strong><em>Immutable Existence.</em></strong> The servant is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form or send it to another plane of existence.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6"><strong><em>Magic Resistant Construction.</em></strong> The servant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and spell attacks made against it have disadvantage.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="6"><strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong> The servant regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.

The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.</p>\n<p>Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons- that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.</p>\n<p>When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.</p>\n<p>Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.</p>\n<p>If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.</p>",

One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</p>\n<p>As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</p>\n<p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.</p>\n<p>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.</p>\n<p>While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb\'s depths and speak its command word.

The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat\'s name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> An <em>Orb of Dragon</em> kind has the following random properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.

    '<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>This delicate and exquisitely crafted clockwork orrery features multiple geared components whose sweeping hands and dials represent the complex interplay of planar and magical realms. Standing two feet high, the orrery housing is a wondrous device imbued with magic of its own, but the power of its six clockwork components makes the artifact even more potent.</p>\n<p>The <em>Orrery of the Wanderer</em> was created by a renowned clockwork mage known only as Lottie. She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm.</p>\n<p>To prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components that powered it, secreting them across the world. But the orrery\'s instinct for survival is strong, and its components have a way of inexorably coming together over decades or centuries, found by treasure hunters, stolen by monsters, found and stolen again - and moving closer to each other all the time.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The orrery has the following randomly determined properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The random properties of the orrery might function only when all its components are installed, or might function sporadically if any components are missing.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Sum of Its Parts.</em></strong> Each of the six components that powers the Orrery of the Wanderer is a powerful magic relic in its own right:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:chronolometer">The Chronolometer</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:dimensional-loop">The Dimensional Loop</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:far-gear">The Far Gear</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:rotor-of-return">The Rotor of Return</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:timepiece-of-travel">The Timepiece of Travel</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:wheel-of-stars">The Wheel of Stars</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Creatures can attune to the orrery\'s components individually.

    "<p id=info><em>Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>Beautiful silver scrollwork and priceless cut rubies adorn this set of brass-and-gold armor. Legend holds that it was worn by Duana, High Priest of the Dawnfather, when she was martyred in the Battle of Ghor Dranas in the final days of the Calamity. In more recent times, it was worn by Pike Trickfoot, a legendary cleric of the Everlight, while fighting against the Chroma Conclave and the Whispered One.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> While the <em>Plate of the Dawnmartyr</em> is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing it. When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to rebuke that creature, dealing it 1d6 fire damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Awakened.</em></strong> When the <em>Plate of the Dawnmartyr</em> reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The armor\u2019s bonus to AC increases to +2.</li>\n<li>You are immune to the frightened condition.</li>\n<li>You have resistance to fire damage.</li>\n<li>The fire damage you deal when you rebuke an attacker increases to 2d6.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Exalted.</em></strong> When the <em>Plate of the Dawnmartyr</em> reaches an exalted state, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The armor\u2019s bonus to AC increases to +3.</li>\n<li>When you rebuke an attacker, you can choose to deal either fire damage or radiant damage.</li>\n<li>When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can choose to have a blast of healing flame surround you.

  "Platinum Scarf":
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)</em></p>\n<p>This scarf is made of sturdy cloth and covered in platinum-colored scales.<br/>\nAs an action, you can pull a scale from the scarf and speak a command word.

A creature wielding the shield has immunity to radiant damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Radiant Hammer.</strong> For 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required), the scale becomes a magic light hammer, which you or another creature can use. The weapon deals 2d4 radiant damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for a light hammer. It deals an extra 2d4 radiant damage to chromatic dragons.</p>\n<p>Once three scales have been pulled from the scarf, no more scales can be removed until the next dawn, when all the missing scales grow back.

The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open <em>portable hole</em> can exit the hole by climbing out of it.</p>\n<p>You can use an action to close a <em>portable hole</em> by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up.

On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the <em>portable hole</em> or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.</p>\n<p>Placing a <em>portable hole</em> inside an extradimensional space created by a <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:bag-of-holding\">Bag of Holding</a>, <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:hewards-handy-haversack\">Heward's Handy Haversack</a>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane.

When you drink this potion, you transform into an adult dragon of the same kind as the dragon the scale came from. The transformation lasts for 1 hour. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying melds into your new form or falls to the ground (your choice). For the duration, you use the game statistics of the adult dragon instead of your own, but you retain your languages, personality, and memories.

  "Potion of Fire Breath":
    "<p id=info><em>Potion, uncommon</em></p>\n<p>After drinking this potion, you can use a bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour has passed.</p>\n<p>This potion's orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the top of the container and wafts out whenever it is opened.</p>",
  "Potion of Flying":
    "<p id=info><em>Potion, very rare</em></p>\n<p>When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover.

  "Potion of Giant Size":
    "<p id=info><em>Potion, legendary</em></p>\n<p>When you drink this potion, you become Huge for 24 hours if you are Medium or smaller, otherwise the potion does nothing. For that duration, your Strength becomes 25, if it isn't already higher, and your hit point maximum is doubled (your current hit points are doubled when you drink the potion). In addition, the reach of your melee attacks increases by 5 feet.</p>\n<p>Everything you are carrying and wearing also increases in size for the duration. When rolling damage for weapons enlarged in this manner, roll three times the normal number of dice; for example, an enlarged longsword would deal 3d8 slashing damage (instead of 1d8), or 3d10 slashing damage (instead of 1d10) when used with two hands.</p>\n<p>When the effect ends, any hit points you have above your hit point maximum become temporary hit points.</p>\n<p>This potion is a pale white liquid made from the tongue of a giant clam, with a pungent aroma akin to that of rotting algae. It tastes sweet, however, when consumed.</p>",

  "Powered Armor":
    '<p id=info><em>Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p id=info><em>Powered Armor</em> resembles a suit of unusual plate armor, with finely articulated joints connected by an oily, black, leather-like material. The armor has been worked to create the appearance of a heavily muscled warrior, and its great helm is unusual in that it has no openings \u2014- only a broad glass plate in the front with a second piece of glass above it. Strange plates, tubing, and large metal bosses adorn the armor in seemingly random fashion. On the back of the armor\u2019s left gauntlet is a rectangular metal box, from which projects a short rod tipped with a cone-shaped red crystal.</p>\n<p>While wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have a +1 bonus to AC.</li>\n<li>Your Strength score is 18 (this has no effect if your Strength is already 18 or higher).</li>\n<li>You have advantage on death saving throws.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The armor has further capabilities that can be powered either by energy cells or by your own life energy. You can use a bonus action to draw power from an energy cell or sacrifice hit points to gain one of the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Emit a force field to gain 2d6 + 5 temporary hit points (1 charge or 5 hit points).</li>\n<li>Activate boosters to gain a flying speed of 15 feet for 1minute (1 charge or 5 hit points).</li>\n<li>Fire arm-mounted laser: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +8 to hit, range 120 feet, one target. <em>Hit</em>: 2d6 radiant damage (1 charge or 5 hit points).</li>\n<li>Translate any writing you can see in any nonmagical language, to a total of one thousand words over 1 minute (1 charge or 5 hit points).</li>\n<li>Fill the armor with air, allowing you to breathe normally in any environment for up to 1 hour (1 charge or 5 hit points).</li>\n<li>Gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet for up to 1 hour (1 charge or 5 hit points).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The armor can accept only one energy cell at a time. It is found with one energy cell attached, containing 2d10 charges.</p>\n<p><strong>Powered Armor Options</strong></p>\n<p>Depending on where and how it appears in the adventure, you might wish to modify the features of Kwalish\u2019s legendary <em>Powered Armor</em>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Automatic Defenses.</em></strong> Unless Kwalish deactivates the suit\u2019s automatic defenses, no one can approach the armor without setting those defenses off. Treat the armor as a <strong>shield guardian</strong> that has stored a <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:magic-missile">Magic Missile</a> spell cast using a 4th-level spell slot. When the armor is reduced to 0 hit points, its defenses are rendered inert and it can be safely approached.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Battle of Wills.</em></strong> When donned by a new user, the armor deems itself superior and attempts to take possession of that user. The user must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the armor. While possessed, the user is incapacitated and loses control of its body but retains its awareness. The armor uses the possessed user\u2019s statistics (as adjusted by the armor), but doesn\u2019t gain access to the user\u2019s knowledge, features, or proficiencies.</p>\n<p>Freeing a creature trapped inside the armor first requires defeating the armor\u2019s automatic defenses (as above). The trapped creature can also attempt a DC 20 Charisma saving throw each day at dawn. On a successful save, the armor no longer controls the creature and can be safely donned by that creature at any time.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Stasis.</em></strong> Whenever a creature wearing the armor drops to 0 hit points, the armor places that creature into a state of stasis. While in this state, the creature is stable and does not make death saving throws, but the armor takes control of the creature (as above). Additionally, the armor attempts to assume the identity of the user, assuring their allies that nothing is amiss. Freeing the user first requires defeating the armor\u2019s automatic defenses (as above). A creature in stasis does not make Charisma saving throws to break the armor\u2019s control.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Alternative Power.</em></strong> <em>Powered Armor</em> originally required energy cells to fuel it, but was adapted by Kwalish to be fueled by the life energy of the creature wearing it. You might decide that the armor can also draw power from additional sources, or that energy cells can be recharged with the aid of a tinker, inventor, or artificer. It might also be possible for allies to connect to the armor through the use of magic that generates a conduit something like an astral silver cord. While so connected, a willing ally can give up hit points as a reaction to fuel the armor\u2019s abilities.</p>',

  "Professor Orb":
    '<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p>\n<p>A <em>professor orb</em> is a smooth 5-pound sphere of smoky gray quartz about the size of a grapefruit. Close examination reveals two or more pinpricks of silver light coming from deep inside the sphere.</p>\n<p>The orb is sentient and has the personality of a scholar. Its alignment is determined by rolling on the alignment table in the "Sentient Magic Items" section in the <em>Dungeon Master\'s Guide</em>. Regardless of its alignment, the orb has an Intelligence of 18, and Wisdom and Charisma scores determined by rolling 3d6 for each ability. The orb speaks, reads, and understands four languages, and it can see and hear normally out to a range of 60 feet. Unlike most other sentient items, the orb has no goals of its own and can\'t initiate a conflict with the creature in possession of it.</p>\n<p>The orb has extensive knowledge of four narrow academic subjects. When making an Intelligence check to recall lore from any of its areas of expertise, the orb has a +9 bonus to its roll (including its Intelligence modifier).</p>\n<p>In addition to the knowledge it possesses, the orb can cast the <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mage-hand">Mage Hand</a> cantrip at will. It uses the spell only to transport itself. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Professor Skant.</em></strong> The <em>professor orb</em> owned by Vellynne Harpell and stolen by Nass Lantomir calls itself Professor Skant. It is lawful good, and it has a Wisdom of 11 and a Charisma of 9. It speaks and reads Common, Draconic, Elvish, and Loross (the dead language of the Empire of Netheril). Professor Skant is a chatterbox and assumes all humanoids are dunderheads. When elaborating on its areas of expertise, it adopts an unintentionally patronizing tone. It has the following four areas of expertise:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The history of Netheril</li>\n<li>Vampirism and the traits of vampires</li>\n<li>Rituals surrounding the making, bottling, and drinking of Elverquisst (a rare, ruby-colored elven liquor distilled from sunshine and rare summer fruits)</li>\n<li>The tarrasque (see the <em>Monster Manual</em>)</li>\n</ul>',

    '<p id=info><em>Ring, artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>The <em>Ring of Winter</em> is a golden band that resizes to fit snugly on the finger of its wearer. A thin layer of frost coats the outside of the ring, which normal heat can\'t melt. The ring feels ice cold to the touch and initially numbs the hand that wears it, but this cold ceases to be felt by one who is attuned to the ring.</p>\n<p>The <em>Ring of Winter</em> is sentient and tries to take control of any creature that wears it (see "Sentient Magic Items" in chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master\'s Guide</em>). If it succeeds, the ring compels its wearer to cause undue harm to everyone and everything around it, in a cold-hearted attempt to incur the wrath of enemies and bring about the wearer\'s doom.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The <em>Ring of Winter</em> is a sentient chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 17. The ring communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it, and it has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The ring craves destruction, and it likes inflicting indiscriminate harm on others.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Nondetection.</em></strong> The <em>Ring of Winter</em> defies attempts to magically locate it. Neither the ring nor its wearer can be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Frozen Time.</em></strong> As long as you wear the ring, you don\'t age naturally. This effect is similar to suspended animation, in that your age doesn\'t catch up to you once the ring is removed. The ring doesn\'t protect its wearer from magical or supernatural aging effects, such as the Horrifying Visage of a ghost.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Cold Immunity.</em></strong> While attuned to and wearing the ring, you have immunity to cold damage and don\'t suffer any ill effects from extreme cold (see chapter 5 of the <em>Dungeon Master\'s Guide</em>).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Magic.</em></strong> The <em>Ring of Winter</em> has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn.

The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of -30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.</li>\n<li>You can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:bigbys-hand">Bigby\'s Hand</a> (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:cone-of-cold">Cone of Cold</a> (2 charges), Flesh to Ice (3 charges; as <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:flesh-to-stone">Flesh to Stone</a> except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:ice-storm">Ice Storm</a> (2 charges), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:otilukes-freezing-sphere">Otiluke\'s Freezing Sphere</a> (3 charges), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:sleet-storm">Sleet Storm</a> (1 charge), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:spike-growth">Spike Growth</a> (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wall-of-ice">Wall of Ice</a> (2 charges).</li>\n<li>You can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can\'t have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator\'s commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the <em>Dungeon Master\'s Guide</em> to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Other Properties.</em></strong> The <em>Ring of Winter</em> is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring can\'t break. Frost giants have long believed that the ring can be used to freeze entire worlds, while a djinni in the service of a Calishite pasha once claimed that the ring could be used to summon and control white dragons, as well as a mighty ice primordial named Cryonax.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Destroying the Ring.</em></strong> The ring is nigh indestructible, resisting even the most intense magical heat. If it is placed on the finger of the powerful arch fey known as the Summer Queen, the ring melts away and is destroyed forever.</p>',

It can't speak, and it doesn't require air, sleep, or nourishment.</li>\n<li>You can relinquish control of the shadow, at which point it becomes autonomous and behaves as the DM wishes. It uses the <strong>shadow</strong> stat block in the <em>Monster Manual</em>, but its creature type is Fey instead of Undead. A creature whose Strength is reduced to 0 by this shadow's Strength Drain attack does not die but falls unconscious instead. The creature regains consciousness and all its Strength after finishing a short or long rest.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A creature whose shadow has detached from it is cursed.

If the target isn\u2019t within range or if there is no clear path to it, the dart falls to the ground, its magic spent and wasted. Otherwise, elemental winds guide the dart instantly through the air to the target. The dart can pass though openings as narrow as 1 inch wide and can change direction to fly around corners.</p>\n<p>When the dart reaches its target, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and 3d4 lightning damage.

As long as the shield is on the same plane of existence as its creator, the mind flayer can see through the shield's eye, which has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. While peering through this magical eye, the mind flayer can use its Mind Blast action as though it were standing behind the shield.</p>\n<p>If a <em>shield of far sight</em> is destroyed, the mind flayer that created it is blinded for 2d12 hours.</p>",
  "Shield of Missile Attraction":

  "Shield of the Hidden Lord":
    "<p id=info><em>Armor (shield), legendary (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>The <em>Shield of the Hidden Lord</em> is of celestial origin and serves as a prison for the pit fiend Gargauth, whose mortal followers revere it as a god. Over time, Gargauth's evil has warped the shield's appearance, so that its celestial motif and designs have become twisted into a fiendish face that subtly moves in disturbing ways.</p>\n<p>While holding this shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and resistance to fire damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The <em>Shield of the Hidden Lord</em> is sentient as long as it imprisons Gargauth. While sentient, the shield has the following properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The shield has an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24, as well as hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet.</li>\n<li>The shield can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature it can sense within 120 feet of it. Its voice is a deep, hollow whisper.</li>\n<li>The shield has 3 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fireball\">Fireball</a> or 2 charges to cast <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wall-of-fire\">Wall of Fire</a> from the shield (save DC 21 for each). The wall of fire spell lasts for 1 minute (no concentration required). The shield regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</li>\n<li>Anytime during your turn, the shield can choose to radiate an aura of dread for 1 minute. (This is not a power of the shield that you control.) Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn within 20 feet of the shield must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this power of the shield for the next 24 hours. Once the shield uses this power, it can't use it again until the next dawn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Gargauth's Personality.</em></strong> Gargauth desperately seeks freedom but can't escape on its own. The pit fiend won't reveal its true nature, referring to itself only as the Hidden Lord. It drops hints and subtle suggestions that it is an angel trapped in an unholy prison. If released from the shield, the pit fiend honors the terms of whatever bargain it struck to facilitate its escape.</p>\n<p>While trapped in the shield, Gargauth carefully steers the shield's current owner toward committing acts of cruelty and domination, hoping to condemn the individual's soul to the Nine Hells. Conflict occurs if the shield's owner does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to find it.</p>\n<p>Gargauth doesn't know how to escape from the shield. The pit fiend believes (incorrectly) that it can break free of the shield if it's brought to the Nine Hells, for it's convinced that the shield's powers are weaker there.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Freeing Gargauth.</em></strong> Casting <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dispel-evil-and-good\">Dispel Evil and Good</a> on the shield has a 1 percent chance of freeing the pit fiend, or automatically succeeds if the spell is cast by a solar, a planetar, or an archdevil. A god can release the pit fiend by touching the shield and speaking Gargauth's name. When released, Gargauth appears in a random, unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible.</p>",

  "Soul Coin":
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p>\n<p id=info><em>Soul coins</em> are about 5 inches across and about an inch thick, minted from infernal iron. Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each <em>soul coin</em> has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Carrying Soul Coins.</em></strong> To hold a <em>soul coin</em> is to feel the soul bound within it \u2014 overcome with rage or fraught with despair.</p>\n<p>An evil creature can carry as many <em>soul coins</em> as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A nonevil creature can carry a number of <em>soul coins</em> equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of <em>soul coins</em> greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Using a Soul Coin.</em></strong> A <em>soul coin</em> has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a <em>soul coin</em> and use it to do one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Drain Life.</em></strong> You siphon away some of the soul's essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Query.</em></strong> You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response. which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Freeing a Soul.</em></strong> Casting a spell that removes a curse on a <em>soul coin</em> frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from <em>soul coins</em> typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.</p>\n<p>A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A <em>soul coin</em> has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a hellfire weapon (BG:DA, page 223) or an infernal war machine's furnace (BG:DA, page 217).</p>\n<p>Freeing a soul from a <em>soul coin</em> is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Hellish Currency.</em></strong> <em>Soul coins</em> are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling. and reward the faithful for services rendered.</p>\n<p id=info><em>Soul coins</em> are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins.

    '<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>The <em>Teeth of Dahlver-Nar</em> are stories given form. They are a collection of teeth, each suggestive of wildly different origins and made from various materials. The collection rests within a leather pouch, stitched with images of heroes and whimsical creatures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Using the Teeth.</em></strong> While you are holding the pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth. Roll on the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar table to determine which tooth you draw, and you can either sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are described later).</p>\n<p>If you don\'t sow or implant the tooth, roll a die at the end of your turn. On an even number, the tooth vanishes, and creatures appear as if you sowed the tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another implanted tooth, see below).</p>\n<p>Each tooth can only be used once. Track which teeth have been used. If a tooth\'s result is rolled after it\'s been used, you draw the next lowest unused tooth on the table.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sowing Teeth.</em></strong> To sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Implanting Teeth.</em></strong> To implant the tooth, you place it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resizing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect column. The tooth can\'t be removed while you are attuned to the teeth, and you can\'t voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose the implanted effect.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Recovering Teeth.</em></strong> Once all the teeth have vanished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with all the teeth then appears in a random destination, which could be on a different world of the Material Plane.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Destroying the Teeth.</em></strong> Each tooth must be destroyed individually by sowing it in the area where the tooth\'s story originated, with the intention to destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others act as their tales dictate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever.</p>\n<table class="wiki-content-table">\n<tr>\n<th colspan="4">Teeth of Dahlver-Nar</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>1d20</th>\n<th>Tale and Tooth</th>\n<th>Creatures Summoned</th>\n<th>Implanted Effect</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>The Staring Cats of Uldun-dar (ivory cat molar)</td>\n<td>9 <strong>cats</strong></td>\n<td>The tooth has 8 charges.

  "The Infernal Machine Of Lum The Mad":
    '<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>This strange device was once thought to have been built by gods long forgotten and to have survived the eons since their passing, for it is incredibly ancient and crafted by means unlike anything known today. However, its true origins derive from a planar craft that crashed in the Barrier Peaks, for the <em>Infernal Machine</em> once functioned as this craft\u2019s central command console.</p>\n<p>Explorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known as the <em>Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad</em>. Yet with Lum\u2019s eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed.</p>\n<p>The <em>Infernal Machine</em> is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Silver Wire.</em></strong> The <em>Infernal Machine</em>\u2019s great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from the machine\u2019s inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature as the silvery cord of an <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:astral-projection">Astral Projection</a> spell, connecting to the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire becomes invisible, astral, and extends to virtually infinite length.</p>\n<p>As long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of the <em>Infernal Machine</em>\u2019s powers, with their effects centered around the user. If the wire is cut \u2014 something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it can cut an <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:astral-projection">Astral Projection\'s</a> silvery cord \u2014 the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them instantly.</p>\n<p>Any effect of the <em>Infernal Machine</em> that requires concentration can be concentrated on by a remote user. The <em>Infernal Machine</em>\u2019s effects have a spell save DC of 14 or the attuned user\u2019s spell save DC, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Summon Monster.</em></strong> When first used by Baron Lum, the <em>Infernal Machine</em> was known for its ability to unleash terrible monsters within the world. Specific combinations of its controls can still recreate the effects of various spells of the conjuration school, as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1/day: <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:conjure-animals">Conjure Animals</a>, <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:summon-lesser-demons">Summon Lesser Demons</a></li>\n<li>1/7 days: <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:conjure-minor-elementals">Conjure Minor Elementals</a>, <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:conjure-woodland-being">Conjure Woodland Being</a>, <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:summon-greater-demon">Summon Greater Demon</a></li>\n<li>1/month: <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:conjure-elemental">Conjure Elemental</a>, <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:conjure-fey">Conjure Fey</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Wish.</em></strong> The <em>Infernal Machine</em> has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish">Wish</a> spell (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming, this feature can be used only once per month.<br/>\nEach time this effect is used, there is a cumulative 10 percent chance of the <em>Infernal Machine</em> malfunctioning, necessitating seven days\u2019 worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> There are far more possible combinations for the <em>Infernal Machine</em>\u2019s controls than can ever be known or matrixed \u2014 especially as the controls shift position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of the user attuned to it, the <em>Infernal Machine</em> generates 1d4 + 1 random beneficial properties and 1d4 + 1 detrimental properties. Roll for each of these properties on the Infernal Machine Properties table. To keep things interesting, the DM might roll secretly for detrimental properties, revealing those properties only during the course of play.</p>\n<p>Once set, these properties last until the end of the attuned user\u2019s next long rest.</p>\n<p>(Our thanks to the D&amp;D community for their suggestions for the properties of the <em>Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad</em>!)</p>\n<p><strong><em>Destroying the Machine.</em></strong> The <em>Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad</em> is self-repairing of anything short of catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum\u2019s time remains a mystery. It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the <em>Infernal Machine</em> will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner workings \u2014 and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked. Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the <em>Infernal Machine</em> to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again.</p>\n<table class="wiki-content-table">\n<tr>\n<th colspan="3">Infernal Machine Properties</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>d100</th>\n<th>Beneficial Property</th>\n<th>Detrimental Property</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>You have a flying speed of 150 feet but lose all other movement.</td>\n<td>You are blinded.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>You can cast the <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:speak-with-animals">Speak with Animals</a> spell at will, but can use it to speak with only one animal of your choice.</td>\n<td>All animals despise you.

  "Wand of Orcus":
    '<p id=info><em>Wand, artifact (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>The ghastly <em>Wand of Orcus</em> rarely leaves Orcus\'s side. The device, as evil as its creator, shares the demon lord\'s aims to snuff out the lives of all living things and bind the Material Plane in the stasis of undeath. Orcus allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time to time. When it does, it magically appears wherever its master senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal.</p>\n<p>Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive in the wand\'s presence.</p>\n<p>Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and rises as a zombie.</p>\n<p>In the hands of one who is attuned to it, the wand can be wielded as a magic mace that grants a + 3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 necrotic damage on a hit.</p>\n<p><strong>Random Properties.</strong> The <em>Wand of Orcus</em> has the following random properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\n<li>2 minor detrimental properties</li>\n<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The detrimental properties of the <em>Wand of Orcus</em> are suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus himself.</p>\n<p><strong>Protection.</strong> You gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while holding the wand.</p>\n<p><strong>Spells.</strong> The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:animate-dead">Animate Dead</a> (1 charge), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:blight">Blight</a> (2 charges), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:circle-of-death">Circle of Death</a> (3 charges), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:finger-of-death">Finger of Death</a> (3 charges), <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:power-word-kill">Power Word Kill</a> (4 charges), or <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:speak-with-dead">Speak with Dead</a> (1 charge). The wand regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>\n<p>While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand\'s spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0).</p>\n<p><strong>Call Undead.</strong> While you are holding the wand, you can use an action to conjure skeletons and zombies, calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit points among, each undead having average hit points (see the <em>Monster Manual</em> for statistics). The undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of the next day, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property of the wand, you can\'t use it again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p>While attuned to the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The undead don\'t perish or disappear at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them.</p>\n<p><strong>Sentience.</strong> The <em>Wand of Orcus</em> is a sentient, chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>\n<p>The wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common.</p>\n<p><strong>Personality.</strong> The wand\'s purpose is to help satisfy Orcus\'s desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cold, cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor.</p>\n<p>In order to further its master\'s goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.</p>\n<p><strong>Destroying the Wand.</strong> Destroying the <em>Wand of Orcus</em> requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life - no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero\'s soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.</p>\n<p>Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly reforms on Orcus\'s layer of the Abyss.</p>',

The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls.</li>\n<li>As an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:globe-of-invulnerability\">Globe of Invulnerability</a> spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne.</li>\n<li>As an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an ancient blue dragon that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an ancient blue dragon's bite and claw attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Destroying the Throne.</em></strong> The <em>Wyrmskull Throne</em> can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can't be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>",
  "Ythryn Mythallar":
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster)</em></p>\n<p>A <em>mythallar</em> looks like an enormous crystal ball held in an ornate cradle. The globe sheds bright light in a 300-foot radius and dim light for an additional 300 feet. The globe draws magic from the Weave that can be harnessed for various purposes. For example, Netherese mages used <em>mythallars</em> to keep their cities aloft and empower their magic items. The bigger the <em>mythallar</em>, the more magic it can hold. The largest <em>mythallars</em> are 150 feet in diameter.</p>\n<p>The <em>Ythryn mythallar</em> is a relatively small device \u2014 a mere 50 feet in diameter. To attune to this <em>mythallar</em>, a creature must finish a short rest within 30 feet of it, meditating on the <em>mythallar</em>. Up to eight creatures can be attuned to it at one time; otherwise, the <em>Ythryn mythallar</em> follows the attunement rules in the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>. If a ninth creature tries to attune to the <em>mythallar</em>, nothing happens.</p>\n<p>All creatures attuned to the <em>Ythryn mythallar</em> can sense when the device is being used. A creature attuned to the device can use any of its properties, but only if all other creatures attuned to the device agree to allow it. The <em>Ythryn mythallar's</em> properties are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While you're on the same plane of existence as the <em>Ythryn mythallar</em>, you can use an action to cause it to fly in any direction you choose at a speed of 30 feet. All matter within 500 feet of the device moves with it. The <em>Ythryn mythallar</em> and all structures held aloft by it hover in place when not in motion.</li>\n<li>As an action, you can cause one magic item you are holding within 30 feet of the <em>Ythryn mythallar</em> to immediately regain all its expended charges or uses. A magic item recharged in this manner can't be recharged by the <em>Ythryn mythallar</em> again until after the item regains expended charges or uses on its own.</li>\n<li>You can use the <em>Ythryn mythallar</em> to cast the <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:control-weather\">Control Weather</a> spell without requiring any components and without the need for you to be outdoors. This casting of the spell has a 50-mile radius. For the duration of the spell's casting time, you must be within 30 feet of the <em>Ythryn mythallar</em> or the spell fails.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Touching the Mythallar</em></strong>. Any creature that touches the globe of the <em>mythallar</em> must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 180 (20d10 + 70) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. Any object that touches the globe, other than an artifact or the <em>mythallar's</em> cradle, is disintegrated instantly (no save).</p>",
  "Book of Vile Darkness (Variant)":
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)</em></p>\n<p>The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil's thrall. No mortal was meant to know the secrets it contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites madness.</p>\n<p>Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em>. He recorded in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.</p>\n<p>Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can't be divined.</p>\n<p>Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.</p>\n<p>A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.</p>\n<p>Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em>, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to neutral evil.</p>\n<p>The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Circle of Death.</em></strong> While attuned to the book, you can cast <a href=\"/spell:circle-of-death\">Circle of Death</a> (save DC 20) from it as an action. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-5, you can't use this property again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Condition Immunities.</em></strong> While attuned to the book, you can't be charmed or frightened.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Evil Presence.</em></strong> The book houses an evil spirit that is hostile toward you. When you become attuned to the book, the spirit tries to leave the book and enter your body. If you fail a DC 20 Charisma saving throw, it succeeds, and you become an NPC under the DM's control until the intruding spirit is banished using magic such as the <a href=\"/spell:dispel-evil-and-good\">Dispel Evil and Good</a> spell. The banished spirit returns to the book.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Adjusted Ability Scores.</em></strong> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't adjust your ability scores again.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mark of Darkness.</em></strong> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Command Evil.</em></strong> While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dominate-monster\">Dominate Monster</a> spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can't use this property again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dark Lore.</em></strong> You can reference the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dark Speech.</em></strong> While you carry the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite word from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Destroying the Book.</em></strong> The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.</p>\n<p>If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.</p>\n<p>A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 x 100 years later.</p>\n<p>If all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed.</p>",
  "Constantori's Portrait":
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</em></p>\n<p>This painting by famed artist Dkesii Kwan depicts Constantori, a beautiful courtier, who was paid a staggering sum to be Dkesii's model. Whether Constantori's actual appearance matches the painting remains a subject of debate. The portrait is one of several paintings commissioned by the late Daiyani Grysthorn, a crime lord who frequently gave magical paintings as gifts to her most esteemed associates.</p>\n<p id=info><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> <em>Constantori's Portrait</em> is a sentient, lawful evil item with an Intelligence score of 14, a Wisdom score of 12, and a Charisma score of 8. It can hear within a range of 120 feet and has darkvision within a range of 60 feet, but it can't see anything behind itself.</p>\n<p>The painting can converse in Common, Draconic, and Elvish as if it were a living person, though Constantori's mouth doesn't move. Whenever conversation occurs within the portrait's auditory range, the painting eagerly gathers secrets, the names of secret tellers, significant events, or any political conversations.</p>\n<p id=info><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> <em>Constantori's Portrait</em> is demanding, condescending, and vain. It doesn't like being covered or placed out of sight, and it loudly condemns anyone who tries to remove it from its gold-leaf frame.</p>\n<p id=info><em><strong>Wealth of Information.</strong></em> The painting's primary purpose is to observe and recall conversations. Over the past few decades, <em>Constantori's Portrait</em> has quietly observed countless conversations and now possesses an unquantifiable amount of lore\u2014everything from criminal conspiracies to secret passwords. The DM decides what the painting knows and what it doesn't.</p>\n<p>While attuned to the painting, you can take an action to telepathically contact it over any distance, provided you and the painting are on the same plane of existence. The painting can't telepathically contact you, however. Maintaining telepathic contact with the painting requires your concentration (as if concentrating on a spell).</p>\n<p id=info><em><strong>Guardian Portrait.</strong></em> While you are attuned to the painting, you can command it to guard its location against one or more creatures you identify as the painting's enemies. The painting performs this function until you command it to stop or until your attunement to the painting ends.</p>\n<p>The painting has 3 charges. When a creature the painting identifies as its enemy starts its turn in a space the painting can see, the painting expends 1 of its charges to cast <a href=\"/spell:magic-missile\">Magic Missile</a> (3 missiles), targeting that creature. The painting regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</p>\n<p>The painting is a Small object with AC 12, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison damage. In its gold-leaf frame, the painting weighs 15 pounds. If the painting has at least 1 hit point and is targeted by a <a href=\"/spell:mending\">Mending</a> spell, it regains 2d6 hit points.</p>",
  "Dagger of Blindsight":

  "Fish Suit":
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, Very Rare</em></p>\n<p>This bulky suit, which fully encases your head and body, takes 1 minute to don or doff. While worn, it enables you to breathe in an airless environment and renders you immune to the harmful effects of any gas that surrounds you. The suit also grants you a swimming speed equal to your walking speed while underwater, or a flying speed equal to your walking speed in an environment with no gravity.</p>",
  "Flying Citadel Helm":
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)</em></p>\n<p>The function of this ornate chair is to propel and maneuver a flying citadel on which it has been installed. The chair has an AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It is destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points.</p>\n<p>The sensation of being attuned to a flying citadel helm is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after one's arm or leg falls asleep, but not as intense.</p>\n<p>While attuned to a <em>flying citadel helm</em> and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use the <em>flying citadel helm</em> to move the citadel through the air up to 80 feet per round, or up to 8 miles per hour.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You can steer the citadel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>At any time, you can see and hear from the highest point outside the citadel as though you were that location.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If no creature attuned to the helm is maintaining concentration, the citadel remains motionless in its space.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Transfer Attunement.</em></strong> You can use an action or bonus action to touch a willing spellcaster, whereupon that creature attunes to the <em>flying citadel helm</em> immediately, and your attunement to the <em>flying citadel helm</em> ends.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Crash.</em></strong> Should the <em>flying citadel helm</em> be destroyed, the citadel it is installed on loses power and begins to crumble. If the crumbling citadel is in the air, it descends at a rate of 30 feet per round, or 300ft per minute. Any creature on the citadel or on the ground within 120 feet of the citadel when it lands must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 39 (6d12) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>",
  "Hammock of Worlds":
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em></p>\n<p>The <em>Hammock of Worlds</em> is a colorful hammock woven with traditional Ataguan designs. It can be used only by a member of the order known as the Green Doctors.</p>\n<p>You can use an action to unfold and place the <em>Hammock of Worlds</em> on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to the Ghost Orchid Tepui in the Feywild or to the Drought Elder in the Far Realm (the user's choice). You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once the <em>Hammock of Worlds</em> has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours.</p>",
  "Kagonesti Forest Shroud":
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)</em></p>\n<p>This cloak appears to be made of autumnal leaves woven together. While you wear this cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and you can use a bonus action to magically teleport, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You then have advantage on the next attack roll you make before the end of the turn. Once this bonus action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>",
  "Mirror of Reflected Pasts":
    "<p id=info><em>Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</em></p>\n<p>This mirror of elven design allows those who stare into it to reflect on positive memories. The 3-foot-tall mirror weighs 25 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points.</p>\n<p>While holding the mirror upright, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. While activated, the mirror hovers in the air, and it can be destroyed but not moved. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again or your attunement to the mirror ends, at which the mirror harmlessly floats to the ground. Once the mirror has been deactivated, it can't be activated again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p>If a non-Construct creature other than you sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become paralyzed until the mirror is deactivated or until the creature can no longer see the mirror. A creature paralyzed by the mirror can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this mirror's effect for the next 24 hours.</p>\n<p>While paralyzed by the mirror, the creature sees events from their past reflected in the mirror's glass. These memories aren't real, but rather idealized versions of those occurrences. Nearby observers can glimpse flashes of these memories if looking indirectly at the mirror.</p>",
  "Rings of Shared Suffering":
    '<p id=info><em>Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>These rings come in linked pairs. If you possess the <a href="/human">Mark of Sentinel</a>, you can use a bonus action to form a link to the creature attuned to the other ring; from then on, whenever that creature suffers damage, they only suffer half of that damage and you take the rest.
